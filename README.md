# Static Site Generator (SSG) - Boot.dev Edition
This is the ssg that I created for a the project, "Build a Static Site Generator in Python"

## Possible Extensions
 - Parse nested inline elements
  - Fix Image elements so they don't need an end tag (i.e. `<img href=""/>` instead of `<img href=""></img>`)
